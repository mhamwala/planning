# Algorithm ideas: 
- 3D Map?
   - jogging in a hilly area
   - cost of energy or fuel 
- Blocked area 2D map?
- robotic movement with goals/tasks?
- indiana jones styled time limited, object avoidence map?
- trash collection, several pick ups, start far or close?
- taxi round trips, multiple locations to meet through several paths
- route to work with three different routes (depending on the goals - fuel, speed)
- solving a maze
- bus route optimization (time, cost?)
- River crossing problem, can this be done through nodes?

## papers to compare to:
- find papers first or algorithm and then find a paper which matches it?
